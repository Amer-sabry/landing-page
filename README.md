## html explanation

This code is an example of an HTML document. The document starts with the doctype declaration, followed by the html element, which is the root element of an HTML document.

The head element contains information about the document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. It also contains links to external stylesheets, which are used to apply CSS styles to the document.

The body element contains the content of the document, which is divided into several sections, such as the header, landing, features and services. Each section is represented by a div element and contains various elements such as images, headings, and paragraphs. The id attribute is used to identify the elements and can be used to link them to other parts of the document or to create anchors.

The li elements inside the ul element in the header are the navigation links, they have the href attribute that points to the id of the corresponding section in the document. The icons used in the features section are from the font awesome library, these icons are styled using css classes.

Finally, the services section contains two columns of services, each column contains several services represented by a div element and each service has an icon, a heading and a description.


## css explanation 

This is a CSS code that styles various elements on a website, including the overall layout, font, and colors.

The first line of code sets the box-sizing property to "border-box" for all elements, which includes the padding and border in the element's total width and height.
The next line of code sets the scroll-behavior property of the html element to "smooth", which enables smooth scrolling on the website.
The body element's font-family is set to "Work Sans", sans-serif, which sets the default font for the website to "Work Sans".
The :root selector is used to define a custom property called --main-color with a value of #10cab7.
The class .container sets the margins for elements with this class to 15px on the left and right side, and the left and right margins are set to auto.
It also uses media queries to change the width of the container class depending on the screen size. It will have a width of 750px for screens with a minimum width of 768px, 970px for screens with a minimum width of 992px and 1170px for screens with a minimum width of 1200px.
The code also styles the header element, which includes the logo and links that appear in the header of the website. It styles the layout, hover effects, and dropdown menu of the links.
The code also styles the landing element, which includes a background image and text that appears on the landing page of the website. It sets the background image, the height and position of the element and position the text in the center of the element.
